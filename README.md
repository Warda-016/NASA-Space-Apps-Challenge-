### 🚀 Project: **Asteroid Hazard Assessment Tool**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our submission to the 2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge! This project was created as part of the **"Imagine Our Connected Earth"** challenge, where we aimed to explore how technology can be used to address global issues using Earth data and models. Our team focused on developing a tool that could monitor and predict the hazard levels of **Near Earth Objects (NEOs)**, such as asteroids.

### 🌟 **Project Overview**
The project is a web-based explanatory tool designed to provide detailed information about **asteroids**, calculate their potential hazard levels, and offer **safety guidelines** to the local population based on the estimated threat.

### 🔍 **Challenge Objective**
We aimed to address the problem of monitoring and analyzing Near Earth Objects to predict potential threats to Earth. Our goal was to provide communities with real-time data and a safety response plan in the event of an asteroid approaching Earth.

### Website Link 🌐
To get a detailed explanation of our project and explore the features of our tool, visit our project’s explanatory website: PakAstro.

### Website Features
- **Asteroid Data**: Information on different types of asteroids, their **composition**, and their potential impact on Earth.
- **Discovery History**: A historical overview of asteroid discoveries, including significant cases of **unexpected asteroid impacts**.
- **Risk Assessment**: Our tool calculates the threat posed by specific NEOs and suggests **precautionary measures** for communities based on the severity of the risk.
- **Asteroid Impact Facts**: Statistics on how frequently Earth has been hit by unforeseen asteroids.

### 🛠️ **Key Features**
- **Asteroid Detection**: Calculates the trajectory and size of asteroids using NASA’s open APIs and publicly available astronomical data.
- **Hazard Assessment**: Analyzes the potential impact based on size, speed, and location to classify the risk level.
- **Community Guidelines**: Offers localized precautionary measures for communities to respond effectively depending on the level of threat.

### 📊 **Data Analysis and Modeling**
We used various space datasets to build models that can predict the impact probabilities and create a comprehensive visualization for understanding the trajectories of these objects.
